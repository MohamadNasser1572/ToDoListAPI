# Todo List API

## Project Overview

This project is a RESTful API for managing a list of todos. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on todos. The API is built using Spring Boot and integrates with a MySQL database.

## Key Components

- **`ToDoListApiApplication.java`**: The main class that starts the Spring Boot application. It sets up the application context and enables web functionality.
- **`SecurityConfig.java`**: Configures security settings for the application, including form-based authentication with an in-memory user.
- **`GlobalExceptionHandler.java`**: Provides global exception handling to return meaningful error messages when something goes wrong.
- **`TodoController.java`**: Handles HTTP requests related to todos. It provides endpoints to create, read, update, and delete todos.
- **`Todo.java`**: Represents the `Todo` entity with fields for `id`, `title`, and `description`. It is used to interact with the database.
- **`TodoRepository.java`**: Provides CRUD operations for `Todo` entities using Spring Data JPA.
- **`TodoService.java`**: Contains business logic for managing todos, including methods to retrieve, save, update, and delete todos.
